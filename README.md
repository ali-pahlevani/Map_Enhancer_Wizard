# Map Enhancer Wizard (V1)

**Map Enhancer Wizard** is a tool designed to enhance 2D Occupancy Grid maps, providing users with an easy way to improve the quality and usability of their maps through a user-friendly interface.

This is **version 1** of the tool. Future versions will include:

- **Additional filters** for more versatile map enhancements
- **Automation features** to streamline the enhancement process
- **AI-powered enhancements** for intelligent map improvements
- Support for **3D maps**

## Preview

## Dependencies

To use this tool, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- opencv-python
- pillow
- pyyaml
- numpy

You can install these dependencies using **pip**:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow pyyaml numpy
```

## Usage

The main file to run is `map_enhancer_wizard.py`. To start the wizard, simply execute the following command in your **terminal**:

```bash
python3 map_enhancer_wizard.py
```

Follow the on-screen **instructions** to load your 2D Occupancy Grid map and apply enhancements.

The wizard will guide you through the process of enhancing your map, allowing you to choose from available options and preview changes before saving.

+ **Note:** Ensure your 2D Occupancy Grid map is in a compatible format. The tool expects a **.yaml** file along with its corresponding image file (e.g., **.pgm**). Basically, youâ€™ll need to **double-click** and select the folder that **contains both** the .yaml and image file of your map.

## Examples

Below are example collages demonstrating the enhancement results. Each collage includes **four images**: **two** showing the **occupancy map** before and after enhancement, and **two** showing the corresponding **cost maps** before and after enhancement.
